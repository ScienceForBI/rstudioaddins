### RStudio Addins

<!-- ![RStudio Addins](img/addins-logo.png) -->

Addins provide a mechanism for executing R functions interactively from within 
the RStudio IDE -- either through keyboard shortcuts, or through the `Addins` 
menu. Addins can be as simple as a function that inserts a commonly used snippet
of text, and as complex as a Shiny application that accepts input from the user,
and later mutates a document open in RStudio. The sky is the limit!

### Getting Started

Let's start by playing around with a couple of the example addins provided
by the [addinexamples](https://github.com/rstudio/addinexamples) package.
Within RStudio, install this package (plus its requisite dependencies) with:

<!-- TODO: Replace this with just 'install.packages()' once 'shinygadgets' -->
<!-- is on CRAN -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinygadgets")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/addinexamples")
```

After installing this package, you should see the `Addins` toolbar menu
populated with the addins exported by this package:

![Addins Menu](images/addins-menu.png)

Try using the `insert_in` addin -- you'll see the text ` %in% ` inserted
at the cursor position.



<!-- TODO: Find and Replace demo? -->

### Developing Addins

You might be surprised to know that `insert_in` is implemented entirely with R 
code. In fact, the R function that made this happen is located
[here](https://github.com/rstudio/addinexamples/blob/master/R/insert-in.R), and
its definition is simply:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
insert_in <- function() {
  rstudioapi::insertText(" %in% ")
}
```

If you want to try something silly, try executing `addinexamples::insert_in()`
directly at the console. You should also see ` %in% ` inserted immediately after
executing the function. This is exactly what RStudio is doing behind the scenes;
it's just allowing you to execute that function through some UI rather than
manually going through the console.

#### Registering Addins

Since addins are just R functions, how does `addinexamples` let RStudio know
what functions are safe to call as addins? This is done through the registration
file located at [inst/rstudio/addins.dcf](https://github.com/rstudio/addinexamples/blob/master/inst/rstudio/addins.dcf).
Each addin you register should have the following four fields:

- **Name**: The name of the addin.
- **Description**: A description of the addin.
- **Binding**: The R function this addin is associated with.
- **Interactive**: Whether this addin is interactive (e.g. as a Shiny application).

If you want to create your own RStudio addins, all you need to do is:

1. Create an R package,
2. Create some R functions, and
3. Create a file at `inst/rstudio/addins.dcf`,

and RStudio will automatically discover and register these addins when your package
is installed.
